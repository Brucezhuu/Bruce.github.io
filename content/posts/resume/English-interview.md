缺点  weakness
My biggest weakness as a project manager is the fact that I used to micromanage my team members, especially when I first started working as a project manager. 
However, I understand that micromanaging is not conducive to effective management, 
[kənˈdjuːsɪv]   [ˈjuːtəlaɪz]利用   [ˈdelɪɡətiv , ˈdelɪɡeɪtiv]授权委派
and that is one of the reasons why I started to utilize a delegative style of management to force myself to allocate tasks based on individual team members` strengths, and then step back， trust them and supervise them from a distance. 
[ˈæləkeɪt] 分配  [ˈsuːpəvaɪz]监督
作为一名经理，我最大的弱点是我过去常常对团队成员进行微观管理，尤其是在我刚开始担任经理的时候。然而，我明白微观管理不利于有效的管理，这也是我开始采用委托式管理的原因之一，我强迫自己根据每个团队成员的优势分配任务，然后退后一步，信任他们并从远处监督他们。
=======================
As for weaknesses, l tend to be overly self-critical at times,
Sometimes I tend to be a perfectionist, which can lead to spending more time on a task than necessary. 
However, I am aware of this and have been working on finding the right balance to ensure efficiency without compromising quality.
l actively work on adopting a more balanced perspective and learning from constructive feedback.
至于弱点，我有时会过于自我批评，但我会积极采取更平衡的观点，并从建设性的反馈中学习
==========================
My greatest weakness is probably my high expectations, both for myself and others.
l tend to be overly critical when things don't meet my standards. 
Recognizing this, l've been actively working on being more patient and understanding, especially in team settings where diverse perspectives and skills come into play.
i've learned that collaboration and flexibility often lead to better outcomes than going it alone. 
Embracing this has not only improved my relationships with colleagues but also enhanced our collective success.
我最大的弱点可能是我对自己和他人的期望很高。当事情不符合我的标准时，我往往过于挑剔。认识到这一点，我一直在积极努力变得更加耐心和理解，尤其是在团队环境中，不同的观点和技能发挥作用。我了解到，协作和灵活性往往比独自行动带来更好的结果。接受这一点不仅改善了我与同事的关系，也增强了我们的集体成功。
离职原因
离职是为了更好的职业发展平台  家庭 
I'm ready for the next challenge in my career. 
l loved the people l worked with and the projects l worked on, but at some point ，l realized l wasn't being challenged the way used to be. 
Rather than let myself get too comfortable, l decided to pursue a position where  can continue to grow.

By fostering open communication and providing support where needed, we completed the project within the deadline
[kəmˈpliːtɪd]
Our efforts resulted in a positive outcome , This achievement showcased my ability to effectively manage projects, communicate with stakeholders, and deliver results.
[ˈɛfəts] [ˈaʊtkʌm]

Why do you want to be a manager?
I want to be a manager primarily because of the level of responsibility that comes with the position. 
I am an energetic, ambitious and driven person, and the role of a manger is very much suited to my natural attributes. 
[praɪˈmerəli]主要 [ˌenəˈdʒetɪk]精力充沛 ˈætrɪbjuːt]
I also want the type of role that keeps me challenged and busy. 
And as a manager, I will be kept busy and challenged all of the time and I find those things appealing. 
[əˈpiːlɪŋ]吸引人的
I also want to be a manager because I will get to coach and motivate people in the role. 
There`s something very rewarding about helping people, taking them under your wing and then training them and coaching them to reach their full potential. 

Finally, I want to be a manager because I am a good organizer and planner of my work. 
I enjoy setting people difficult targets to achieve and also implementing  guidelines for others to follow and then supporting them to achieve an organization`s goals.
我想成为一名经理，主要是因为这个职位所带来的责任感。我是一个精力充沛、雄心勃勃、有干劲的人，经理的角色非常适合我的天性。我也想要那种让我充满挑战和忙碌的角色。作为一名经理，我会一直保持忙碌和挑战，我觉得这些事情很有吸引力。我也想成为一名经理，因为我将在这个职位上指导和激励人们。帮助别人，把他们放在你的保护之下，然后训练他们，指导他们充分发挥潜力，这是非常有益的。最后，我想成为一名经理，因为我是一名优秀的工作组织者和规划者。我喜欢为人们设定难以实现的目标，也喜欢为他人实施程序指南，然后支持他们实现组织的目标。
What is your management style?
My management style is very much dependent on the situation I am faced with and I will often use either an autocratic, delegative or transformational style of management. 
[ˌɔːtəˈkrætɪk]独裁者的;专制的;专横的[ˈesns]   of the essence本质的;极其重要的;不可或缺的;
So, I will use an autocratic style of management when time is of the essence, when I need to get things done quickly and give people clear directions. 
[ˌtrænsfəˈmeɪʃən(ə)l]变革型;转换;转换型;转化;转换性;
I will use a delegative style of management to allocate team tasks based on individual strengths. 
And then finally, I will use a transformational style of management to coach, train and motivate the people  in my team to implement the changes requested by the senior management team.
我的管理风格在很大程度上取决于我所面临的情况，我经常使用专制、授权或转型的管理风格。所以，当时间是最重要的，当我需要快速完成事情并给人们明确的方向时，我会使用专制的管理风格。我将采用委派式管理方式，根据个人优势分配团队任务。最后，我将使用转型型管理风格来指导、培训和激励团队中的人员，以实施高级管理团队要求的变革。
How would you deal with a low performer in your team?
I will deal a low performer quickly and robustly because if you ignore it as a manager, it sends message to the rest of your team that perhaps you don`t have high standards or expectations and it can then quickly demotivate them. 

So, I would first down with the low performer and ask them questions to determine the reasons why they were not performing to the expected standard, because they may have personal problems at home that they were dealing with, in which case I would support them. 

Or they may feel they have not received the right training to do their job properly, in which case I would deliver the right training. 
And then finally I would put a plan of action in place to get them back up to speed quickly and then closely monitor them until they were back up to the expected standard. 
我会迅速而有力地处理一个表现不佳的人，因为如果你作为一名管理者忽视它，它会向团队的其他成员传递一个信息，即你可能没有高标准或高期望，这会很快让他们失去动力。因此，我会首先与表现不佳的人交谈，向他们提问，以确定他们没有达到预期标准的原因，因为他们可能在家里遇到了个人问题，在这种情况下，我会支持他们。或者他们可能觉得自己没有接受过正确的培训来正确地完成工作，在这种情况下，我会提供正确的培训。最后，我会制定一个行动计划，让他们快速恢复速度，然后密切监控他们，直到他们恢复到预期的标准。

如何领导说的话不对，你怎么办
In my job , l was in charge of putting together reports for potential company investments. lt was important to get the details and numbers right so that leaders had the best information to make a decision. 

One time, my boss asked me to generate a new report on a Wednesday morning and wanted it done by Thursday at 5PM.

Because l'm committed to high-quality work and l wasn't sure my boss fully understood what goes into each report, l knew I needed to speak up. At her next available opening, l sat down with my boss and explained my concerns. 

he was firm that the report would be completed by Thursday at 5 PM. So l decided to ask if there was anyone who could help out. 

After thinking about it, my boss found another assistant who could put in a few hours. While it was a tight timeline, we got the report done, and the committee was really pleased to review it at the meeting. 

My boss appreciated my extra efforts to make it happen and l felt good that l hadn't let the quality of the report slipIt was a good experience of being a team player but also knowing when and how to ask for help. And once l explained how much time and work goes into each report, my boss was careful to assign them further in advance.
分享领导经验
i think that a good leader is someone who can make decisions while also listening to others and being willing to admit when you're wrong and course correct. 

in my last role my team and l were responsible for giving a big presentation to a prospective client.

quickly assigned different tasks to members of my team, but the project never really got moving.
l gave everyone an opportunity to share their input and concerns, and it turned out that they were struggling in the roles i'd given them.

l ended up switching a few people around.
Meanwhile, the employee i'd assigned to give the presentation was nervous, but still wanted to give it a try.
[rɪˈhɜːs]排练
 l worked with them to make sure they were ready and even held a practice session so that they could rehearse in a more comfortable environment. 
When the time came for the real thing, they nailed it! We landed the client and the company still has the account to this day. 
[neɪld]盯牢，抓住    寻求协助的 qo-to
And that employee became a go-to person for important client presentations.
 i'm really glad l took the time to listen to everyone's concerns 
so that l could re-evaluate my approach and help my team be the best it could be.
[ˌriː ɪˈvæljueɪt]再评价

我认为一个好的领导者是一个能够做出决定的人，同时也能倾听他人的意见，并愿意承认自己的错误和正确的方向。
在我的上一个职位上，我和我的团队负责向潜在客户做一个大型演示。
很快给我的团队成员分配了不同的任务，但项目从未真正开始。
我给了每个人一个机会来分享他们的意见和担忧，结果发现他们在我给他们的角色中遇到了困难。
我最后换了几个人。
与此同时，我指派做演示的员工很紧张，但仍然想试试。
我和他们一起工作，确保他们准备好了，甚至还举行了一次练习会，这样他们就可以在更舒适的环境中排练。
当真材实料的时候到了，他们成功了！我们找到了客户，公司至今仍拥有该账户。
这位员工成为了重要客户演示的首选对象。
我真的很高兴我花时间倾听了每个人的担忧
这样我就可以重新评估我的方法，帮助我的团队做到最好。
