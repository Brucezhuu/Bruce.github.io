# Cloud Computing Quick Reference Guide

## 1. Cloud Native vs Cloud Enabled Applications

- **Cloud Native**:
  - Developed with cloud principles from the ground up, designed for multi-tenancy, elastic scaling, and easy integration.
  - Often built using microservices architecture, containers (like Docker), and managed through orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).

- **Cloud Enabled**:
  - Traditional applications moved to the cloud without major redesign.
  - Typically relies on Lift and Shift or minimal refactoring, using IaaS or basic PaaS offerings.

- **Example**:
  - **Cloud Native**: Netflix's microservices architecture, using AWS Lambda and Kubernetes for scaling.
  - **Cloud Enabled**: Migrating a monolithic e-commerce app to AWS EC2 instances without modifying the architecture.

## 2. Types of Software Architects in Cloud Solutions

- **Enterprise Architect**: Oversees strategic technical direction and solutions for the organization.
- **Solution Architect**: Converts requirements into architecture for specific solutions.
- **Application Architect**: Ensures application design aligns with requirements.
- **Data Architect**: Manages data design and database structures.
- **Infrastructure Architect**: Designs servers, network, and storage infrastructure.
- **Security Architect**: Focuses on network and data security.
- **Cloud Architect**: Specializes in cloud migration strategies, cloud-native applications, and governance.

## 3. Cloud Reference Architecture

- **Layers**:
  - **Networking**: Ensures connectivity, uses virtual networks and security groups.
  - **Storage**: Manages file, object, and block storage solutions.
  - **Servers/Compute**: Virtual machines, containers, and functions (FaaS) for running applications.
  - **Virtualization & OS**: Hypervisors like KVM, and container runtime environments.
  - **Middleware & Runtime**: Enables application execution, often managed via container platforms.
  - **Applications & Data**: Applications (e.g., microservices) with underlying databases and data lakes.

- **Key Tools**:
  - **Observability**: Prometheus, metrics-server for monitoring.
  - **Service Mesh**: Istio, Envoy for managing microservices communication.
  - **Kubernetes**: Manages containerized applications across clusters.

## 4. Why Go Cloud Native?

- **Elasticity**: Scale up resources dynamically for handling varying loads.
- **Modern Applications**: Ideal for greenfield projects, IoT, mobile, and SaaS integrations.
- **APIs and Integration**: Easily integrates with external services via APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Facebook for authentication).
- **Resilience**: Automatically provisions environments to handle failures, improving reliability.

## 5. Migration Models

- **Lift and Shift**:
  - Minimal work required, fast migration, but does not utilize full cloud benefits.
  - Suitable for early-stage cloud migration where agility is needed without high costs.

- **Partial Refactor**:
  - Modify specific components to leverage some cloud-native features.
  - Balances cost and cloud benefit.

- **Complete Refactor**:
  - Redesign application to be cloud-native, optimizing for performance and scalability.
  - Higher cost and complexity, ideal for applications requiring high resilience and scalability.

## 6. Common Reference Architectures for Cloud Native Applications

- **Monolithic**: Single, unified application, best for simple, low-scale applications.
- **Microservices**: Decentralized services, suited for large-scale, dynamic applications.
- **Serverless**: Executes code on-demand without managing infrastructure, ideal for event-driven workloads.
- **Event-Driven & Stream Processing**: For real-time data processing and analytics, e.g., IoT data processing.
- **Data Lakes and Big Data**: Structured for storage and analysis of large datasets.

## 7. Cloud Deployment Models

- **Private Cloud**: Infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, either on-premise or hosted.
- **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure owned by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.
- **Multi-Cloud**: Uses multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in and improve reliability.

## 8. Vendor-Specific Reference Architectures

- **AWS**: Architecture Center provides guidance on setting up scalable, reliable applications (e.g., e-commerce, disaster recovery).
- **Microsoft Azure**: Offers architecture documentation for building cloud solutions with Azure services.
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Solution catalog includes reference designs for data analytics, machine learning, and Kubernetes.
- **IBM, Oracle, Huawei, Telekom**: Each provider has tailored architectures for various business needs and regions.

## 9. Multi-Cloud Strategies

- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces dependency on a single provider.
  - Enhances disaster recovery by spreading services across providers.

- **Challenges**:
  - Increased complexity in management and interoperability.
  - Needs unified monitoring and security controls across platforms.

## 10. Architecture for Different Use Cases

- **E-commerce**:
  - Use microservices for scalability.
  - Incorporate CDN (e.g., CloudFront) for faster content delivery.

- **Online Gaming**:
  - Real-time processing with minimal latency.
  - Use geographically distributed data centers for better performance.

- **Big Data Processing**:
  - Use data lakes, distributed storage, and compute clusters.
  - Integrate data streaming services for real-time analytics.

- **Disaster Recovery**:
  - Multi-region data backup and replication.
  - Automated failover and backup strategies.

## 11. Popular Cloud Reference Architectures

- **NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture**: Describes core actors and interactions in cloud environments.
- **IBM Multicloud Architecture**: Focuses on managing multiple cloud providers with unified policies and procedures.
- **CCRA (Cloud Computing Reference Architecture)**: Defines typical building blocks for cloud computing services.
