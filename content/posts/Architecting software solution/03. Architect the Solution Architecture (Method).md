## 1. Defining Requirements

- Tasks:
	1.	Collect Stakeholder Requests.
	2.	Capture Common Vocabulary.
	3.	Define System Context.
	4.	Outline Functional & Non-Functional Requirements.
	5.	Prioritize Requirements.
	6.	Detail Functional & Non-Functional Requirements.
	7.	Update the Solution Architecture Document (SAD).
	8.	Review Requirements with Stakeholders.

- Step 1: Outline the Functional Requirements and Create the System Context
	- Functional Requirements:

	Based on the case study, the functional requirements are as follows:

		- Retrieve Historical Records: The system must allow medical staff to access student historical medical records from the mainframe system.
		- Perform Health Screenings: Enable medical staff to conduct health screenings (e.g., vision, hearing, weight, height) and record results.
		- Manage Immunization Records: Track and update immunization records during screenings.
		- Appointment Scheduling: Allow medical staff to schedule appointments for further check-ups or missed screenings, with data exchange between SHS and the mainframe system.
		- Generate and Print Screening Results: Print results on-site for insertion into student health booklets.
		- Statistical Reporting: Enable SHB staff to consolidate and analyze screening data, generating monthly reports.
		- Manage Student Profiles: Add, modify, or update student profiles within the system.
	- System Context:
		The system context defines the key actors interacting with SHS and the flow of information. Here’s a simplified view:

		- Actors:
			- Medical Staff: Interacts with SHS at schools to perform screenings, schedule appointments, and print results.
			- SHB Staff: Accesses SHS to generate reports and manage student profiles.
			- Mainframe System: Provides historical data and processes appointment requests.
		- Interactions:

			SHS interacts with medical staff on-site at schools and connects with the mainframe system for historical records and appointments.
		- Data flows include reading historical records, writing new screening results, scheduling appointments, and producing reports.

- Step 2: Identify and Detail Key Functional Requirements Influencing Architecture
Key Functional Requirements:
	- Use Case 1: Retrieve Historical Records
		- Description
		Medical staff need access to a student's historical medical records to ensure continuity and accuracy in health assessments and treatments.

		- Primary Actor
		Medical Staff (Nurses, Doctors)

		- Secondary Actor
		Mainframe System

		- Main Flow of Events
			- Medical staff initiates a request for a student’s historical records in SHS by entering the student’s ID or NRIC.
			- SHS sends a query to the mainframe to retrieve the student’s historical data.
			- The mainframe system processes the request and sends back the historical records to SHS.
			- SHS displays the historical records on the medical staff’s device for review.
			- Medical staff reviews the data to proceed with the screening process.
		- Alternative Flow of Events
			- Mainframe System Unavailable:If the mainframe is unavailable, SHS informs the medical staff that historical records cannot be accessed.SHS enters a "degraded mode," allowing the medical staff to proceed with the screening without access to historical data.Once the mainframe connection is restored, the medical staff can attempt to retrieve the records again.
			- Student Record Not Found:If the entered student ID or NRIC does not match any records in the mainframe, SHS notifies the medical staff that no records were found.Medical staff may re-enter the ID or NRIC for confirmation or proceed without historical data.
		- Pre-Conditions
			- The medical staff has a valid login and access rights to view student records.
			- The mainframe system is online and accessible from the school’s location.
		- Post-Conditions
			- Historical medical data is displayed on the SHS interface for the medical staff’s review.
			- In cases where data was unavailable, SHS logs the issue for later retrieval attempts or reports to SHB staff.
	- Use Case 2: Generate and Print Screening Results
		- Description
		After completing a health screening, medical staff must print a summary of the screening results to insert into the student’s health booklet, ensuring that the student and their guardians have an accessible copy of the results.

		- Primary Actor
		Medical Staff (Nurses, Doctors)

		- Secondary Actor
		Printer (Local on-site printer)

		- Main Flow of Events
			- Medical staff completes a student’s health screening and saves the results in SHS.
			- Medical staff selects the option to generate a screening summary report.
			- SHS compiles the recorded screening data into a formatted report for printing.
			- SHS sends the formatted report to the local on-site printer.
			- The local printer prints the report.
			- Medical staff retrieves the printed report and places it in the student’s health booklet.
	- Alternative Flow of Events
		- Printer Unavailable:If the printer is offline or unavailable, SHS notifies the medical staff that the report cannot be printed immediately.SHS stores the printable report in a queue or local storage to print later once the printer becomes available.Medical staff receives a notification once the report is successfully printed.
		- Incomplete Screening Data: If the screening data is incomplete, SHS alerts the medical staff and prevents the printing of the report. Medical staff can review and complete missing data entries before attempting to print the report again.
	- Pre-Conditions
		- Medical staff has completed the student’s health screening and saved all necessary data.
		- The local printer is set up and connected to SHS.
	- Post-Conditions
		- A printed report is generated and available for insertion into the student’s health booklet.
		- If printing was unsuccessful, the report remains available in SHS for a later printing attempt.

- Step 3: Outline Non-Functional Requirements
Grouped Non-Functional Requirements:
	- Performance: The system should handle high-volume screening data and allow medical staff to access historical records within a few seconds.
	- Availability: SHS should provide 99% availability and support offline mode to allow uninterrupted operation during outages.
	- Usability: Designed for low IT-literacy users, with an intuitive interface and minimal steps for core tasks.
	- Security: Ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission, storage, and archival.
	- Scalability: The system should scale to handle over 10 million student records annually.

- Step 4: Identify and Detail Key Non-Functional Requirements Influencing Architecture
Key Non-Functional Requirement:
Availability (Degraded Mode for Offline Operation):
	- Scenario Details:
	- Stimulus: Network or system outage at the school during a screening session.
	- Source: Network provider or internal system failure.
	- Response: The system enters a degraded mode, allowing data entry for essential functions (e.g., screenings) without network connectivity. Data syncs with the mainframe once the network is restored.
	- Response Measure: Data entry must continue for up to 5 hours offline, with data seamlessly synced post-restoration.
